# Multidimensional scaling of a high-dimensional dataset data set baseball-2016.xlsx contains information about the scores of baseball teams in USA in 2016

In this project 
- Scale the data in order to perform a multidimensional scaling (MDS).
- performs a non-metric MDS with Minkowski distance=2 of the data (numerical columns) ino two dimensions.\
  Visualize the resulting observations in Plotly as a scatter plot in which observations are colored by League.
- Plotly to create a Shepard plot for the MDS performed
- Produce series of scatterplots in which you plot the MDS variable that was the best in the differentiation between the leagues in step 2 against all other numerical variables of the data.
  Pick up two scatterplots that seem to show the strongest (positive or negative)
